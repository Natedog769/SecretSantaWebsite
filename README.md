# SecretSantaWebsite
This is a website I made completely from scratch, I created the server code in JS and used basic HTML and CSS for the front end. It has a login system so users can log in, enter what they want and pick from the pool of users as their pick
I created this as a personal challenge as a way for my family to do the secret santa picking remotely
Users make an account name and password and they can then add items to their wishlist. Then when everyone has finished their account they can roll for their pick, the server will randomly get another user and display their name. Once ready you lock in the pick and its all set. I even included a little global chat feature.
The website use to be hosted on Digital Ocean but was taken down for cost reasons. Nonetheless I am proud of this little website. I made it in a matter of days between Thanksgiving and the first of December.
